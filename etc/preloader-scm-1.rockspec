		Lua preloader is a script that generates C code that precompiles Lua code
		as modules that can be pre-loaded into a Lua execution state.
		It works as a sort of replacement for the old bin2c application that used
		to be included in the Lua distribution, however it is primarily intended
		to pre-compile and pre-load scripts that implement Lua modules.
